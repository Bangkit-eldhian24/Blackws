# <summary><strong>BLACKWS ( BLACKARCH WEB SECURITY TOOLS ) </strong></summary>

## NOTE :
I created this tool as a pentest and ethical hacking installer for the Arch Linux distribution. It focuses on web security and also ignores tools with problematic/invalid PGP keys from the official BlackArch maintainer.
